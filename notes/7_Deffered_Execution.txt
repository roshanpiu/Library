### Defered Execution
Defered Execution means query execution occures some time after the query has been constructed

## Query variable stores query commands
## Execution is deffered until the query is iterated over

IQueryable<T>: creates an expression tree
The query is not sent to the datastore until the iteration happens

Iteration:
    foreach loop
    ToList(), ToArray(), ToDictionary(),
    Singleton queries - Max(), Count()
